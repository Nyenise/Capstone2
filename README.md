# Capstone2
Capstone Project for Side Hustle cohort 5
This is the second capstone project for the Side hustle Cohort 5 HTML+CSS+JS course. This is a simple webpage with only a navigation bar and a form.
For the navigation bar, no framework was used, just CSS but a framework was used for the form. The framework used was Bootstrap. For the validation of the form, vanilla javascript was used.
